## Introduction
This is a continued work of the sentiment analysis that my group (Hazel Gabutan, Stephen Bizimana) and I have done at Wright State University for Applied Machine Learning under Dr. Tanvi Banerjee. Given the Twitter dataset that was cleaned and preprocessed, I want to do Topic Modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

## Dataset
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
The dataset was preprocessed for Sentiment Analysis project and prepocessed again for this Twitter Tweets Topic Modeling project. 

## Software packages
For this project, I used different kinds of packages to be able to achieve my goals.
Here is the list of packages:
* NLTK - for text processing
* Pandas - for importing csv dataset
* Gensim - for LDA

## Goal
* Generate topics from the tweets in the dataset. 
* Make word cloud and/or LDA Visualization (pyLDAvis) based on frequency of texts.
* Generate a graph and table of perplexity vs. number of topics.
