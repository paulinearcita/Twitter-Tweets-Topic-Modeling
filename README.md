# Twitter Tweets Topic Modeling

## Introduction
This is a continued work of the sentiment analysis that my group and I have done at Wright State University for Applied Machine Learning under Dr. Tanvi Banerjee. Given the Twitter dataset that was cleaned and preprocessed, I want to do Topic Modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

## Dataset

The dataset was preprocessed for Sentiment Analysis project and prepocessed again for this Twitter Tweets Topic Modeling project. 

## Goal
* Generate 5 to 20 topics from the tweets in the dataset. 
* Make word cloud and/or LDA Visualization based on frequency of texts.
* Generate a graph and table of perplexity vs. number of topics.
